# Real Estate Web Scraper
## About The Project
This project involves scraping real estate listing data from a website to collect information on properties in Round Rock, TX. The application retrieves details such as price, number of bedrooms, half-baths, square footage, address, and city from multiple pages of listings. The extracted data is then compiled into a structured format and saved as a CSV file for further analysis. This project demonstrates the use of web scraping techniques to gather and organize data from dynamic web pages.
